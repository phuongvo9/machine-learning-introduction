# Regression
**Regression is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers**

 In regression, a machine learning algorithm is trained on a dataset where the correct output (a number) is given for each input, and the algorithm learns to predict a numerical output for new, unseen inputs. The predicted output can be any number, such as a price, a probability, a temperature, etc. 

 
# Real-world applications
Regression is used in many real-world applications, include (but not limited):

*   **Predicting housing prices:** A learning algorithm is given data showing the size of houses in square feet and their corresponding prices. The algorithm learns from this data how house size relates to price. Once trained, the algorithm can predict the price of a house based on its size. The predicted price could be any number (e.g., $150,000, $200,000, etc.). In this case, the algorithm is trying to fit a straight line, curve, or another function to the data
   
*   **Input/output mapping:** The algorithm learns a mapping from input to output (x to y) where x is the input (e.g., house size) and y is the output or label (e.g., house price).
*   **Training:** Regression models are first trained with examples of inputs x and the correct outputs y. After training, the model can take a new input and try to produce the corresponding output.
*   **Economic value:** Supervised learning, including regression, is responsible for a large amount of the economic value created by machine learning

*   **Stock price prediction:** A learning algorithm is given data showing the price of a stock over time. The algorithm learns from this data how the price of a stock changes over time. Once trained, the algorithm can predict the future price of the stock. The predicted price could be any number (e.g., $100, $200, etc.). In this case, the algorithm is trying to fit a curve to the data
